#
ArcGet.py -a cbscentral -s ${1} -r MEMPRAGE\ RMS,Minn_HCP_1.5mm_Task

experiment="Exploration" # must match directory name

# fileNames should correspond to order in which scans were taken, e.g. normally it's fileNames=(struct run001 run002 run003 run004 run005 run006 run007 run008)
# HOWEVER, if things are out of order or some scans were bad, might have to reorder and include dummy entries for the bad scans,
# e.g. if the structural was bad and you took another structural in the end, it would look like this: fileNames=(struct_bad run001 run002 run003 run004 run005 run006 run007 run008 struct)
fileNames=(struct run001 run002 run003 run004 run005 run006 run007 run008)
